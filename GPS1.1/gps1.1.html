        <h3>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Despite the popular image of the solitary programmer hunkered down 
        in a basement coding by his or herself, the reality is that most 
        programming is done in pairs. Therefore, it is important that DBC boots 
        learn how to program in pairs so that they can apply their skills in the 
        workforce. In addition, it is necessary to be able to work with others 
        in all facets of life.</p>
        <h3>What does Pairing mean?</h3>
        <p>Pairing is a collaborative effort between two or more individuals
        that flows as a conversation with a designated end goal.</p>
        <h3>Define Driver and Navigator</h3>
        <p>The driver is the person on the keyboard actually writing the code,
        and remains conscious of the direction the code is taking, while the 
        navigator provides that direction.</p>
        <h3>What was it like pairing for the first time?</h3>
        <p>We thought the pairing session went well, particularly because we are of
        similar skill-levels. We also had a similar understanding of what it meant to
        pair, and what the roles of driver and navigator meant. This made for a
        painless process that was overall enjoyable.</p>
