	    		<p>	So many of the values listed stood out to me that it was impossible to selectively pick one, so I chose one at random from the list of values I felt aplied to me. I got community, which I feel is an important one. To belong to a group lets you awknowledge that there are things in the world bigger than yourself. Sometimes we forget that the world doesn't revolve around us. Being a part of a community comes with certain expectations. It is a sort of extended family. A community can be there for you to lean on and seek support from when you need it but it also requires you to give back in the same way. Sometimes we don't realize it but giving back is one of he best things we can do for ourselves. 
	    			
	    		</p>
	    			
	    		<p>
	    			In general I think I would agree, that I do try to live up to these values and uphold my part with whichever community I am associated with. For the next three months I'll be a part of the DBC community and I hope to give as much to DBC and the people I meet there as I can. I hope that we all succeed together and come out on the other end as family. 
	    		</p>

	    		<p> I think community and sterortype threat kind of work together as opposing forces. Community, if you're fortunate enough to belong to one, lets you feel like you are part of an exclusive group. It is a support system which ultimately battles sterotype threat directly. Sterotype threat is you telling yourself you can't do something becaause other around you told you, you can't. But if you have a strong community surrounding you telling you that you can, then all you need to do is tell yourself it's true.
