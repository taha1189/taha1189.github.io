	    			My learning stye is best characterized as Abstract Random. What this means is that I tend to tailor my tasks to my needs and learn in a manner that feels most efficient to me. I also prefer to cooperate on projects as opposed to work individually. I feel that a noncompetitve environment allows for innovation and creativity. I believe a healthy balance of social acitivities and work create a work enviorment conducive to success. I do find however, that the repitition of menial tasks is mentally exhausting and takes away from the potential for positive results. I think the ability to personlize information and a tendency to think outisde the box is a valuable asset to have for a web developer. I find that having this learning style also makes me highly adaptable to changing environments and makes it easy for me to adopt a flexible working situation, a quality that I believe is necessary at Dev Bootcamp where we will be challenged daily and pushed to the edge of our capacity, testing all our self-imposed limitations.

	    			I found that my biggest struggle that came with Dev Bootcamp has to do with time management. I told myself that when the actual class started, it would be my one and only priority for three months. But I assumed that during the prepwork, because it wouldn't take all day, I could find ways to still be involved in all the other aspects of my life while fullfilling my responsibilties for DBC. I'm finding however that DBC requires more time and effort from me than I had previously expected. I feel that every week I'm working on my material til the last minute before the deadline and theres always more information I could have went over that I tell myself I'll go back to if I have time. It's already the end of week 3 and I now have material from this week and the two previous weeks piled up that I want to skim over at some point. I find I enjoy the structure of DBC in that there are specific tasks that need to be addressed, it helps with creating a weekly schedule but I wish it wasn't so specific and so heavy on writing content such as reflections and blogs, and focused more on solidifying fundamental concepts for the programming languages we'll be using. And because of the specificity of each challenge I find myself dreading some work when I could be learning from a more valuble resource, for example, I found the code combat challenge to be tedious, and I didnt learn much from it. Going through Codecademys Javascript tutorial would have been a better use of time, and because there is so much to do now, time is definetely of the essence, and every minute counts.

					As far as a persons' mindset goes the underlying concept seems to me that no one person is set in their ways when it comes to learning. We all have the capacity to expand mentally. Even if we don't realize we're doing it, but we keep an opne mind to it we can change the way we learn, and our brain can adapt to the type of information we are trying to retain. I think the main thing to take away is that we should keep an open mind in regards to what we learn. We should act as sponges, at least for the next four months, accepting every piece of information thrown at us. We should maintain a positive outlook, be open to pair with others and accept the fact that we could potenttially learn something of value from these people. Positive attitudes seems to be the primary differentiating factor between a person of a fixed mindset and of a growth mindset. It is said that "The more appetites a man has, the richer he is." and I believe those are words to live by. The more we are open to, the more capable we are of understanding and accepting.
