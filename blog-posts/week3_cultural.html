	    			My learning stye is best characterized as Abstract Random. What this means is that I tend to tailor my tasks to my needs and learn in a manner that feels most efficient to me. I also prefer to cooperate on projects as opposed to work individually. I feel that a noncompetitve environment allows for innovation and creativity. I believe a healthy balance of social acitivities and work create a work enviorment conducive to success. I do find however, that the repitition of menial tasks is mentally exhausting and takes away from the potential for positive results. I think the ability to personlize information and a tendency to think outisde the box is a valuable asset to have for a web developer. I find that having this learning style also makes me highly adaptable to changing environments and makes it easy for me to adopt a flexible working situation, a quality that I believe is necessary at Dev Bootcamp where we will be challenged daily and pushed to the edge of our capacity, testing all our self-imposed limitations.
