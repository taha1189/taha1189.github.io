	    			"The program today is a thousand times better than it was yesterday, but it's still far from being awesome". I feel, as my first week of prep comes to a close, I can see what Shereef means. To start off, I want to mention that I dont think I've ever put so many consistent hours into something and actually enjoyed it. The gratification of watching my HTML and CSS come together throughout the week is pretty amazing and like Dev Bootcamp I felt MY programs become much more advanced and complex in their code in a short period of time. For that reason alone, I'm putting my trust in this program. 
	    			I'm looking forward to a paradigm shift from the restaraunt mentality to the kitchen one. Of course I dont expect to be a master chef by the end of Dev Bootcamp but I hope by the end of it I'll be confident in my abilties as a junior programmer. Confident enough to know that I have what it takes to overcome any major programming hurtles.
	    			I'm extremely excited and also slightly nervous for what is to come. I can't begin to imagine what the workload will be like.
