	    		<p>
	    			"Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks." To fully understand what this means, let us go back to the beginning...

	    			In its most basic form, Ruby is an object oriented programming language known for its readablility. It is similar in structure to the english written language and doesn't adhere to the strict constructs of most other programming languages. It aims to be user-friendy as opposed to other languages which are more concerned with being computer friendly.

	    		<p>
	    			<strong>Rails</strong> is a software library that can be added to the Ruby programming language. It is a Ruby gem that is added via the computers command line and is a framework for building websites. What this means is that Rails can combine the Ruby programming language with the front-end design of HTML and CSS as well as Javascript to create web applications.

	    			A more in-depth explanation of Ruby on Rails would be that it is a Model-View-Controller framework fro creating <strong>database-driven</strong> websites in Ruby. But what is a Model-View-Controller framework?
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Model-View-Controller or (MVC) is a way to divide the web application into different sections. The model is responsible for database interactions, the controller handles all the web server interaction and the view generates the HTML code that is displayed to the user. In lamens terms, it can be described as a tri-level system. The user interface is the first layer in which the user can interact with the application via the browser much like they would any website. The application layer is the middle section which utilizes Ruby to communicate between the user layer and the database layer. The database layer is the third and final layer which stores all the user data. An example could be a user purchasing items online, the users info. would be stored in the database, including the items in their cart and personal info, etc.

	    		<p>The Rails Philosophy</p>
	    		<ul>
	    			<li><strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." The idea behind DRY code is that developers shoudl ensure to write reusable code which will make their programs more maintainable. </li>
	    			<li>Convention Over Configuration: The Rials framework has "opinions" on how to do certain things to maintain best practices. This ensures that the developer doesn't have to waste time with tedious work and can focus on the bigger picture</li>
