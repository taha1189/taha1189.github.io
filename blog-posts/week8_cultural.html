	    		<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>

	    		
	    		
	    		<p>
	    			Not too long ago I got into a spat with a good friend. We've kown each other since high school and our friendship has had its share of ups and down but nothing like this. They say familiarity breeds contempt and there had been tension between us for weeks. Everything he would say irked me. Every time he would breathe I got annoyed. He was constantly critical of others but lacked self-awareness. He was a horrible self-critic to the point of dillusion. It bothered me and so I started voicing my opinion. He refused to filter his opinion and so every time he became critical of others I let him know how others felt about him. This "emotional conflict" soon turned into a physical one. Partially because he relaized everything I was saying was true and partially because he didn't know how else to respond. He was used to speaking his mind about others but rarely did he have others vocalize his own shortcomings.

	    			In retrospect I feel that I may have not gone about the situation appropriately. The escalating tension was one-sided. As far as I know he had no idea how I felt before I openly bashed him. It must have come as a shock to him. At the end of the day though I guess there was a certain understanding that "brothers" fight and after a few days went by I texted him like nothing had happened and he responded the same. The three days between the fight and my texting him however gave me some perspective into the type of person I am. Having looked at the Compass of Shame I found that I fall into more than one cateogry. I exhibit traits from all four but mainly from Avoidance and Withdrawl. I find that in tenseful situations I try to distract myself. I do things outside of my daily routine that could potentially be dangerous at times. I find that even though  I feel I handled the situation well with my friend and we resolved our issues, we didn't really discuss the problem at hand. We didn't talk about what really bothers us and how to avoid issues in the future. Could it be that we just forgave and forgot in the moment but could be bottling up how we really feel, which could potentially lead to outbursts and fights in the future?

	    			I think conflict in general is bad for me personally. I seek out distractions that could sometimes be harmful, but if every person fits into a group from the Compass of Shame, is one group really any better than any of the others? If I could go back I would try to find a way to break the Compass of Shame and not wallow in guilt every time something bad happens. I need to learn to keep living regardless of who might hate me at the moment. And I need to learn to not get down on myself becaue others might be down on me. Just because they may feel a certain way about me at the moment doesn't mean they're right. Which makes me wonder, just becuase I had a problem with my friend doesn't necessarily mean that I was right. I think the key to all of these issues to be able to maintain an opne line of communication with others and effectively express or opinions in the most objective way possible, to not only spare peoples feelings but to also avoid conflict. I found that people tend to become defensive when they feel like they are being attacked and no longer want to hear what you have to say.

	    			This exercise helped me learn some things about myself. Things I laready knew but had never conciously though about and categorized. I learned how I cope with certain situations which may not be the best way to go about it, but I guess the first step to fixing a problem is admitting there is one.
