	    		<h3>Functional VS. Object Oriented Programming</h3>

	    		
	    		<p>	There are several difference programming paradigms that have come into existence since the creation of computing. Among them are the widely 		famous object oriented style, and the lesser used, functional style.
	    			The fundamental difference between functional and object oriented programming, it would seem, is the fact that object oriented programming is very dynamic and functional programming works on a purely static level. While reading up on the difference between the two I actually had trouble wrapping my head around the concept of functional programming, only being familiar with Ruby, I dont have a great frame of reference when it comes to programming languages, but what purpose could a language serve that avoids state and mutable data?

	    			Object oriented programming in its most basic form is a programming concept that uses "objects" as its fundamental data structure used to manipulate data fields and methods. The methods within the object classes function to control specific aspects of the program and as a whole, these classes work with other classes for the creation of web applications, games, etc... Objects generally tend to represent real-world "objects". Methods can be used to correspond to real-world actions that the specific object in question might undertake, allowing the program the control the virtual object in much the same way as a person would control it in real life. AN example could be an online shopping cart for your favorite website. The online shopping cart could be updated with new merchandise you put in there as well as merchandise you take out. You can also check-out of the shopping cart and purchase the merchandise, much like the real world.

	    			Functional programming on the other hand is based more in mathematics. It serves primariy for education purposes. The fundamental concept of object oriented programming that is not present in functional programming is the idea of mutable variables/objects. In functional proramming once variables are assigned they cannot be changed, otherwise referred to as immutable variables.
