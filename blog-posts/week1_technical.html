	    			<h4>Netflix</h4>
	    			<p>Netflix happens to be one my favorite sites because it allows me to stream my favorite shows online. Out of all the sites I frequent Netflix is definetely on the top 5 which is why I chose it for my blog. When you first navigate to Netflix' website you'll notice that it has a very clean interface. There aren't any loud colors or distracting images. In fact Netflix caters the viewing experience to every individual by populating the home screen with suggestions based on their previous viewing experience. The Homepage provides a simple scrolling system to navigate through the list of suggestions, which at times feels like it may not be the most effecient way to find new title to watch. Fortunately there is an easy to navigate drop-down menu fur users to find new selections by filtering through different criteria. There is also ofcourse a search menu if users already know the title they are looking for. In this way, Netflix makes it rather easy to find exactly what you want. The prupose of the site varies depending on what you are looking for. Netflix is chock full of content from comedy's to drama to documentaries. As a habitual binge-watcher I find I spend way too much time on netflix unfortunately. Unless I restrict myself I find I end up feeling like I wasted a lot of time on Netfix somedays.</p>

	    			<h4>Twitter</h4>
	    			<p>Twitter is my one stop shop of websites. What  I mean by that is, I can literally get almost all the days information from twitter. Depending on who you 'follow' there are no restrictions to what information comes to your feed. From News sources to Entertainment, Twitter has it all.  As far as social media goes, Twitter is so addictive I forget to log onto Facebok for days. If you log onto the site for the first time youll find it's easily navigable. Even for a first time user you can be on your way in minutes. Twitter provides a clean, simple interface where users can view others tweets from their homepage or tweet from their profile. The focus of the content on twitter varies but twitter has a conveneient list feature where users can organize the tweets they recieve my category. Other than that there's really only one way to browse twitter. From top to bottom, reading tweets as they come in. Unfortunately, searching for specific content on twitter is much more difficult becuase the only way twitter really stores content is by associating hashtags to the media but even sifting through relevant hashtags can be time consuming. I definetely waste too much time on twitter unfortunately. Users can literally spend all day on twitter because theres constantly new content coming in.</p>

	    		<div id="bbc">
	    			<h4>BBC</h4>
	    			<p>Among a few other sites, BCC is really where I go to read up on current events. When you first navigate to BBC's website you'll find it follows what you would expect would be a normal template for any news site. Your eyes are drawn immediately to the 'Top News Story' section which takes up a majority of the home page. From there if you scroll down you will receive the news in order of priority from standard news to business news to sports. From a visual perspective, BBC's site could be considered quite boring. It's relatively simple but in a way that makes it feel like it's missing something as opposed to a clean user interface. Although the BBC site has a Comedy section, the overall theme of BBC is more serious. They prioritize breaking news and current events. The site itself is genrally straightforward and easy to navigate. There is a standard menu at the top dividing stories by cateogry. Browsing through the content is generally easy as well as each section has 4 or 5 of the most important stories in that cateogry, you can go from one cateogry to another, reading up on current events with minimum hassle.</p></div>
