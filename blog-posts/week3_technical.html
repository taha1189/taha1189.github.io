	    		<h3>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are its limitations?</h3>

	    		
	    		<p>
	    			Javascript derives it popularity mainly from the fact that its object based, or a prototyping laguange where every object is an instance of a class, meaning it is very versatile.
	    			
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Despite Javascripts limitations, it is suited to large classes of non-web related applications which makes it a well-rounded programming language.
	    			Javascript is great because it has been around for so long that is has various tools accessible to it, it is easy to debug and it allows for object oriented programming. Lastly, Javacript is usefull because it is a client-side web development program, so it is not a strain on the web-server, it is relatively fast for the user, and it can be easily manipulated.
	    			
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Aside from the fact that earlier implementations of Javascript were riddled with bugs, one major limitation that Javascript poses for web developers is that the reserved words assosicated with the Javascript are much stricter than most other back-end languages. 
	    			Another downfall of Javascript syntax is the mandatory usage of semi-colons, and other such tedious syntactical requirements such as the notation for literal regular expressions.
