	    		<h4>Pairing</h4>
	    		<p>
	    		So... I honestly had no idea what to expect when we started DBC in regards to pairing. I assumed that everybody would be at a different level with Ruby and personality types might conflict, but it turns out pairing may be the one of my favorite aspects of DBC. I came in with the mindset that pairing would be more like my current skillset on display for others to judge, but it feels more like friends hanging out discussing something we're passionate about.

	    		Sometimes however, I feel myself wondering what is the real purpose behind pairing. I know DBC claims that pairing cultivates an accelerated learning environment, but I feel that is not always the case. In my experience over the past 5 weeks I've always had a good pairing session when myself and my pair are prepared and have looked at the challenge ahead of time and have a general understanding atleast, of what is expected of us if not a solid executable plan of action. Now there have been a few times - and I'm thankful for them, if for nothing else, at least they provided some insight - where myself and/or my pair may NOT have been adequately prepared and the pairing session was not optimal. It just feels like too much pressure to come up with solutions on the spot. Often times theres awkward pauses and long periods of radio silence when we both happened t be stumped and are playing in the IRB trying to figure out an appropriate solution. Can this really be the best way to learn? I find, I like to take my time with these challenges, I like to read what is required of me, think about it, possibly diagram it and/or pseudocode it, code it, research new techniques, and then sit back and reflect on what I did and hope it stored somewhere in my long-term memory bank. Regardless of all that however, I do understand the importance of being able to work with others, especially in an environment where the stereotype says it is not required. That can be quite misleading and we have DBC to thank for bringing us into good habits early on.

	    		<h4>Feedback</h4>
	    		<p>
	    		I'm actually quite proud of my feedback. I thought to myself before starting my first pairing session to just handle the situation on a human level and it seems to have worked for me. For the most part my pairs have said that I made them feel comfortable and able to express their ideas, thoughts, ad concerns with the fear of being judged.I've been told that I'm easy to communicate with and at the end of the day it has helped make for really enjoyable pairing sessions. I dont know that the feedback was helpful to my learning, most of the advice I received was more personal as opposed to what I could do to improve pairing sessions. Most people felt I did a good job switching between driver and navigator roles but some felt that I could have timed the switch better. It is definitely something I will work on for future pairing sessions. Someone also felt that I was too shy (but he doesn't know what he's talking about... just kidding, sort of).

	    		After writing my first few pieces of feedback I realized how hard it actually is to give Kind, Actionalbe, and Specific feedback. For one, all those things feel so similar it's hard to differentiate the difference while actually giving feedback. Foor another, if you don;t give feedback right away it can be hard to remember which pair did what. Something I definitely need to work on is giving feedback right after a pairing session.The most difficult thing about writing feedback for me however is probably giving actionable advice. It is a lot easier to tell someone how much you enjoyed working them when you had a good pairing session as opposed to telling someone how they can improve. It's even harder giving actionable advice while trying to remain kind. I know kind and nice are not the same thing but I feel that the concept of telling people how to improve or "fix" something theyre doing is automatically taboo which falls under the borderline unkind territory. Hopefully my peers don't feel I've been rude in giving feedback vut if the feedback I recieved is any indication, I'm doing okay so far...
