	    		<h3>Asking the right questions</h3>

	    		<h4>The Golden Rule: Imagine You're Trying To Answer The Question</h4>
	    		<p>
	    			The idea it would seem, is to make sure that the question being asked adheres to all the rules of common sense. What this means as an answer seeker, is that you need to step back and consider your question objectively. If you were to read the question woithout and background knowledge on the topic, would you still understand what is needed? Even if you don't know the answer, do you know what the question is asking? The question should be worded in a way that it makes it easy for anyone reading who knows the answer to actually provide it. If the person reading the question however may know the naswer but would have to clarify with you first on what exactly you are asking just becuase they are not sure, it is probably easier for them not to respond at all. That being said, lets consider a few basics of technique in regards to the art of asking questions.
	    		</p>

	    			<h4>Question Title</h4>
	    		<p>
	    			"It's important that the question title is specific though, and has at least some meaning with no other information. A question such as 'Why doesn't this work?' makes absolutely no sense without the rest of the question. Likewise a 'question' title of 'Please help' is unlikely to do well."
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			When writing a question on a blog or a forum like Stack Overflow it is important to realize that the reader is scrolling through a forum of nothing but questions. That being said it is important to make sure that your title sticks out as it is the probably the only thing they are looking at while scrolling. A specific title that is concise and to the point by explaining exactly what the question topic or theme of the problem is, is the best way to peak a persons interest and have them stop in favor of answering your question.
	    		</p>

	    		<h4>Context</h4>
	    		<p>
	    			The body of the question should contain everything the reader needs to know, without being overwhelming. There are certain things that NEED to be mentioned in the body and if left out can leave the person reading annoyed and they may possibly avoid answering your questions in the future. It is important to include the obvious information required pertaining to the question such as the language being used as well as the platform, etc.
	    			Also any restrictions, rules, or guidelines to the program should be mentioned, so that the person answering doesn't answer the question in a way that is not allowed. Having to explain to them that it goes against he rules of the instructions can be emabarassing for you and annoying for them. It also helps to briefly explain what you tried in regards to solving the problem and where you fell short.
	    		</p>

	    		<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
	    		<p>
	    			"Make sure it's obvious what you're trying to get out of the question. Too many 'questions' are actually just statements: when I do X, something goes wrong.

					Well, what did you expect it to do? What are you trying to accomplish? What have you already tried? What happened in those attempts? Be detailed.."

	    		</p>

	    		<p>
	    			It is important to keep your reader in mind. Always make sure to word the question in a way where they wont be left asking more questions, but rather know exactly what you need. It will help them help you and it will increase your chances of having your question answered.
	    		</p>

	    		<p>
	    			I find those to be the main priorities in asking questions the right way. Obviously there are other factors involved that don't pertain to the actual art of asking questions but rather things like, being polite, and using proper grammar, but for this  blog post I chose to focus only on one aspect of asking questions, and that was more on structure and content.
