	    		<h3>Classes in Object Oriented Programming</h3>

	    		
	    		<p>
	    			 Before Object Oriented Programming there was Procedural Programming. The fundamental underlying concept of Object Oriented Programing that differentiates it from the older style of programming is the use objects which allow for re-usability of code.
	    			</br>
	    			Object Oriented Programming (OOP), utilizes data structures known as "objects" which incorporate procedures known as "methods".
	    			
	    		</p>
	    			TO fully understand the fundamentals of OOP there are 3 basics that need to be covered.
	    			<ul>
	    				<li>Objects</li>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Everything in OOP can be represented as an object. Each object is characterized by 2 traits, that state it is currently in, and actions available to the object. Objects in programming are often used to represent real-world objects.</li>
	    					</ul>
	    				<li>Classes</li>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Classes can be described as the blueprint from which objects are created. The classs represents the object as a whole.</li>
	    					</ul>
	    				<li>Inheritance</li>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Inheritance offers a concise way to organize and structure your software. Although Classes offer the blueprint for your objects, objects can still differ. For example, the objects of class Bike will have similar qualities and functions however, Inheritance can allow for differences in the Bike suhc as mountain bikes or tandem bikes.</li>
	    					</ul>
	    				</ul>


	    		<p>
	    			
	    		</p>
	    		
	    		<p>
	    			Now lets look at a real-world example of a bike:
	    		</br></br>
	    			Class Bike(wheels, speed)</br>
					</br>
 					  def initialize</br>
 					 	 @wheels = wheels</br>
 					 	 @speed = speed</br>
 					  end</br>
 					  </br>
  					  def speeding</br>
 					  end</br>
 					  </br>
 					  def driving</br>
 					  end</br>
 					  </br>
 					  def braking</br>
 					  end</br></br>
					end</br>
	    		</br>
        			In this example we are going to build a bike from the class Bike blueprint. We take the users input for number of wheels and the speed of the bike and initalize them as instance variables to be used throughout the program. we then create different methods for the functions of our bike such as accelerating, steering, and braking.
