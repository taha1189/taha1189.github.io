	    		<p>
	    		After much research, it seems that the tech industry is riddled with problems and not enough developers in the world to fix them all.
	    		This probably stems from the fact the the tech industry is constantly evolving. It is evolving at a much faster pace than any of us can
	    		keep up with. One issue however that caught my attention and I couldn't help but agree with is that, technology doesn't always work...
	    		As simple as it may seem, when you stop to consider it for a moment you realize all the implications this can have. Sure, we feel the daily
	    		fustrations of ineffective technology all the time. Our GPS on our phone never seems to work when we REALLY need it, our laptops crash and we lose
	    		months worth of personal data, etc... But what we fail to realize is that the fact that technology is advancing daily means we rely on it more and 
	    		more for bigger and more important things.
	    			
	    		</p>
	    		
	    		<p>

	    		Our lives have gotten to a point that we can control everything from the palm of our hands. But what happens when the technology on the other end stops working. Sure, your Bank App may be on the fritz and you are temporarily locked out of the system, but you'll be back on soon enough. All it takes is a quick phone call to your local bank on your lunch break. But what happens when the technology running the bank is on the fritz. Technology at that level has the potential to reveal sensitive customer data or even bring cities to a temporary halt. In the case of American Airlines, defective technology and system glitches caused them to ground all their planes. We are accepting these advances in technology with a blind eye and relying fully on them without taking any precautions and without realizing that the technology may not yet be capable to fully meet all our needs. 

	    		<p>

	    		What can we do to aleviate the stress of ineffective technology? I for one tend to rely heavily on it. I trust in Google more than anything else. Which when you think about it, says a lot. Google like anything is a brand anf if you ask anyone, for the most part they will tell you that it is probably their preffered engine of choice. Why is that? Because Google strives to always be effective. They have the best people working on the best technology, all the time. They catch and glitches, and slip-ups before they can ever affect us. The idea is not to stop relying on technlogy or to set up a back-up plan against faulty technology, but rather for the tech companies to implement a higher standard. Of course, nobody is perfect and accidents do happen but if we could put our trust in ALL the technology we use on a daily basis the same way we put our trust in names like Google, the world could be a safer place... technically.
