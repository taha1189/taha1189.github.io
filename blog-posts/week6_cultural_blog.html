	    		<h3>Sterotype Threat</h3>

	    		
	    		
	    			
	    		<p>
	    			"Sterotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative sterotype about one's group" (Steele & Aronson, 1995). It seems by this definition that sterotype threat really works as a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the classix case of, if you consistently tell a kid he'll amount to nothing, it's more than likely to come true and vice versa. But what is a kid to do? Surely we can't lock ourselves out completely from the opinions of the outside world. And thus, sterotype threat. What's more is that research shows that anyone is susceptible to sterotype threat for whom "the situation invokes a sterotype-based expectatin of poor performance." Research also shows that when an individual conciously categorizes themselves within a certain group to which the sterotype applies, they are more likely to feel the negative effects of sterotype threat. A woman may consider that women in general are known to be bad drivers in accordance with the common sterotype and as such she will believe that she herself is innately a bad driver from the beginning.

	    			Personally I've felt the effects of sterotype threat most of my life. I've outgrown it now. how, I'm still unsure, but I'm thankful. Possibly when I reached college. People in college are more accepting of others differences. But up until then I was a social outcast. Unathletic because of my height and build. Generally uninterested in sports altogether, watching and/or playing. I read more than talked. Born and rasied in Chicago, a third generation citizen, but still, I was the brown kid from India so kids insisted on talking to me in their own made up language. In an attempt to fit in I tried to become more interested in sports, but who would give me a chance to play? I was set in my ways. I also felt a sort of reverse effect of sterotype threat. I found that because I was Indian people generally expected more from me academically. You're Idian, they would say. You should be getting straight A's. If only sterotype threat worked for me then. I found myself out performing my peers but it wasn't good enough. My cousins who I'd hear about often from my parents and grandparents were shining stars. Thats who I need to be like, they would say. I found myself stuck in the middle, unaccepted my either side, to the kids I grew up with they always saw me as the outsider brown kid. Even later when ignorance subsided substantially, and we became closer, I was still not one of them. And to my family and relatives, I was the black sheep that spent too much time with the wrong kind of people and it was showing in my academics.

	    			I've since learned to embrance every part of who I am. I'm ashamed to say I used to be ashamed of where I came from, but no more. People now are happy to appropriate every part of my culture, the food, the clothes, and the customs. The same people, who when we were younger used to dance circles around me speaking what I assume was a made up Native American dialect in their best effort to replicate their idea of a Native American dance. I wish I could impart some sort of sagacious wisdom to anyone who reads this but the fact is everybody probably experiences some sort of stereotype threat at some point in their life. The best thing to do is just roll with the punches and be proud of who you are, because you cant change it no matter how hard you try.
