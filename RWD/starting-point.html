      <p>Responsive Web Design was the answer to the problem of "changing landscapes". In essence, due to the fact that the internet was now readily accessible on different mediums such as smart phones and tablets, users expected to be able to browse the web with as much ease on these new devices as they did before on their personal computers. For this reason, web developers started creating various versions for each website to accomodate the new devices. In retrospect, due to the fact that the technology industry is continously evolving it did not seem like a permanent fix to continue to create two versions of every site. Thus Responsive Design was born.</p>

      <p>The fundamental concept behind responsive design lies in the fluid gird. The standard before hand-held web browers were readily accessible, and when everyone viewed websites primary on a computer-sized screen, was that websites were created using fixed wisth layouts. The web pages would be designed using pixels as the primary unit of measure to modify changes to the appearance of the website. This process would create a standard layout which at the time was acceptable due to a lack of various screen resolutions.</p>
      <p>The idea behind creating Fluid grids is that, by using percentages as opposed to a pixel count for the new unit of measure, the website can become adaptable to the size of the screen. When used conciously, the site can be designed so that all of the elements on the page will "resize their widths in relation to one another."</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
     <!-- Discuss the purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts and whether
      you think it's good practice to use them.
      Add html tags where necessary.-->
      <p>After learning the fundamental concepts revolving around Responsive Web Design and Fluid Layouts we feel that it is not only the best practice, but should always be 
          incorporated into any website or webapp. Because of todays technology constantly evolving it seems at though screen size is getting smaller and smaller and most people
          primarily access the internet via their hand-held devices, on the go. This seems like something any serious web developer should keep in mind while creating their sites.

     <!-- Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
      You don't need to keep these questions visible.
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
          After going through all the resources privided and making sense of everything, implementing responsive web design was relatively easy. I feel that this was a great project to work on with a pair. It helped tremendously with any concepts I was unsure about to have someone workign with me whom I could ask.

        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
          Technology will continue to evolve and as such so will standard practices in HTML. I feel that implenting responsive web design is near mandatory considering almost everyone now accesses websites from their phones or tablets. 

        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
          Web tools are so advanced that there is no reason why the visually impaired shouldnt be allowed to use the internet. There should be some way that websites can be automated to read the text should someone need it.

        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
          None of the concepts i learned about seem stupid per se. SOme of the work does seem tedious however. When trying to make the site adaptable for different screen sizes, we wrote 3 versions of the same code for large screens, medium screens, and small screens. This may not be the appropriate way to go about the situation but it is the only was we knew how and it felt inefficient.
